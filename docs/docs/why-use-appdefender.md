# Why Use AppDefender

Serverless function has revolutionize cloud deployment with speed, ease of maintenance and cost benefits.  But at the same time, this convenience sometimes carries risks.  The runtimes and the common dependency on many open source libraries can make it hard to know exactly what's happening. Not updating the packages exposes you to newly discovered vulnerabilities, but updating could also pull in fresh hacks. Wouldn't be great to limit your function executions to exactly what you or your developers had implemented, nothing more, nothing less?  _No pinging unknown servers; no leaking secret environment variables or credentials; no joining of botnets; no file access to your source code; no spawning backdoor processes; no wasted time hunting for hacks in log files; much easier time getting SOC 2 certification._  If these scenarios keep you awake at night, you need **active real time protection**.
